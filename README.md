# WooCommerce Email Text Edit

This plugin allows you to edit email texts that are used in WooCommerce customer emails without having to edit the default templates that WooCommerce uses for emails. 

Unlike other plugins, it will not overwrite your existing templates.

## Usage

After you’ve installed the plugin, go to WooCommerce > Settings > Emails and select a customer email that you want to edit. You’ll find a new edit field where can edit the content of the email.
